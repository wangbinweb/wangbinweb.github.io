<p>“To Be Human”<br />
(feat. Labrinth)</p>
<pre><code>[Sia:]
Under rich, relentless skies
I&#39;ve been setting highs
I felt you walk right through me
You&#39;re the thing that I invoke
My all persistent goal
Sent to make me crazy

[Labrinth:]
And though it&#39;s hard now
With time, it works out

[Sia &amp; Labrinth:]
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I&#39;m not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I&#39;m not ready to give up

[Sia:]
All the tigers have been out
I don&#39;t care, I hear them howl
I let them tear right through me
Can you help me not to care?
Every breath becomes a prayer
Take this pain from me

[Labrinth:]
And though you&#39;re so far now
So far from my arms now

[Sia &amp; Labrinth:]
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I&#39;m not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I&#39;m not ready to give up

To be human
To be human
To be human

Just &#39;cause I predicted this
Doesn&#39;t make it any easier to live with
And what&#39;s the point of knowin&#39; it
If you can&#39;t change it?
You can&#39;t change, can&#39;t change it
Just &#39;cause I predicted this
Doesn&#39;t make it any easier to live with
And what&#39;s the point of knowin&#39; it
If you can&#39;t change it?
You can&#39;t change, can&#39;t change it

To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I&#39;m not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
There&#39;s no reason to give up

[Sia:]
Don&#39;t give up
Don&#39;t give up</code></pre>
